# Breast-Cancer data analysis and prediction

Breast cancer is considered a dangerous disease due to its death rate. It is one of the diseases that could be cured if the disease is identified in the early stages, before it starts spreading across all the parts of the body. In this notebook we are attempting to create an accurate model, in the absence of which a medical professional may diagnose the disease incorrectly due to misinterpretation. We used the Wisconsin breast cancer dataset for our analysis. The dataset contains several feature dimensions extracted by fine needle aspiration and advanced imaging techniques. 

We employed several machine learning algorithms like logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, quadratic discriminant analysis, kernel principal component analysis and neural networks. Neural networks gave us the highest accuracy of 98.6% with a precision of 98% and recall of 98%.
